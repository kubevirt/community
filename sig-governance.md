# SIG Roles and Organizational Governance

This charter adheres to the conventions described in the
[Kubernetes Charter README]. It will be updated as needed to meet the current
needs of the Kubernetes project.

To standardize Special Interest Group efforts, create maximum transparency, and
route contributors to the appropriate SIG; SIGs should follow these guidelines:
- Have an approved Charter [SIG charter process].
- Meet regularly, at least for 30 minutes every 3 weeks, except November and
  December.
- Keep up-to-date meeting notes, linked from the SIG's page in the community
  repo.
- Record meetings and make them publicly available on the
  [Kubernetes Community YouTube playlist].
- Record activity and complete the [annual report].
- Participate in release planning meetings, retrospectives, and burndown
  meetings, as needed.
- Ensure related work happens in a project-owned GitHub org and repository,
  with code and tests explicitly owned and supported by the SIG, including
  issue triage, PR reviews, test-failure response, bug fixes, etc.
- Use the [forums provided] as the primary means of working, communicating,
  and collaborating, as opposed to private emails and meetings.
- Ensure contributing instructions (CONTRIBUTING.md) are defined in the SIGs
  folder located in the Kubernetes/community repo if the groups contributor
  steps and experience are different or more in-depth than the documentation
  listed in the general [contributor guide] and [devel] folder.
- Help and sponsor working groups that the SIG is interested in investing in
- Track and identify all [KEPs] and other project enhancements.

The process for setting up a SIG or Working Group (WG) is listed in the
[sig-wg-lifecycle] document.

## Roles

### Notes on Roles

Within this section, "Lead" refers to someone who is a member of the union of a
Chair, Tech Lead, or Subproject Owner role. Leads may, and frequently do, hold
more than one role. There is no singular lead to any Kubernetes community
group. Leads have specific decision-making power over some part of a group and
 thus, additional accountability. Each role is detailed below.


Initial roles are defined at the founding of the SIG or Subproject as part of
the acceptance of that SIG or Subproject.

### Leads

#### Activity Expectations

- Leads *SHOULD* remain active and responsive in their Roles.
- Leads taking an extended leave of 1 or more months *SHOULD* coordinate with
  other leads to ensure the role is adequately staffed during their leave.
- Leads going on leave for 1-3 months *MAY* work with other Leads to identify a
  temporary replacement.
- Leads *SHOULD* remove any other leads that have not communicated a leave of
  absence and either cannot be reached for more than one month or are not
  fulfilling their documented responsibilities for more than one month.
  - Removal may be done through a [super-majority] vote of the active Leads.
  - If there is not enough *active* Leads, then a [super-majority] vote
    between the remaining active Chairs, Tech Leads, and Subproject Owners may
    decide the removal of the Lead.

#### Requirements

- Leads *MUST* be at least a ["member" on our contributor ladder] to be
  eligible to hold a leadership role within a SIG.
- SIGs *MAY* prefer various levels of domain knowledge depending on the role.
  This should be documented.
- Interest or skills in people management.

#### Escalations

- Lead membership disagreements *MAY* be escalated to the SIG Chairs. SIG Chair
  membership disagreements may be escalated to the Steering Committee.

#### On-boarding and Off-boarding Leads

- Leads *MAY* decide to step down at anytime and propose a replacement. Use
  lazy consensus amongst the other Leads with fallback on majority vote to
  accept the proposal. The candidate *SHOULD* be supported by a majority of
  SIG contributors or Subproject contributors (as applicable).
- Leads *MAY* select additional leads through a [super-majority] vote amongst
  leads. This *SHOULD* be supported by a majority of SIG contributors or
  Subproject contributors (as applicable).

- Number: 2+
- Membership tracked in [sigs.yaml]
- *SHOULD* define how priorities and commitments are managed. *MAY* delegate to
  other leads as needed.

- *SHOULD* facilitate meetings but *MAY* delegate to other Leads or future
  chairs/chairs in training.
- *MUST* ensure there is a maintained CONTRIBUTING.md document in the
  appropriate SIG folder if the contributor experience or on-boarding knowledge
  is different than in the general [contributor guide]. *MAY* delegate to
  contributors to create or update.
- *MUST* organize KubeCon/CloudNativeCon Intros and Deep Dives with CNCF Event
  staff and approve presented content but *MAY* delegate to other contributors.
- *MUST* ensure meetings are recorded and made available.
- *MUST* coordinate sponsored working group updates to the SIG and the wider
  community.
- *MUST* coordinate communication and be a connector with other community
  groups like SIGs and the Steering Committee but *MAY* delegate the actual
  communication and creation of content to other contributors where appropriate.
- *MUST* create the yearly [annual report] for the group but *SHOULD* get help
  with curation from other SIG participants.

#### Tech Lead

  other contributors to fulfill these responsibilities for individual proposals

Additional information on the Tech Lead role can be found in
[technical-lead.md]; within the [Chair & TL Contributor Documentation].

#### Subproject Owner

- Scoped to a subproject defined in [sigs.yaml]
- Seed leads and contributors established at subproject founding
- *SHOULD* be an escalation point for technical discussions and decisions in
  the subproject
- *SHOULD* set milestone priorities or delegate this responsibility

  [SECURITY_CONTACTS]
- *MUST* be a contact point for the Security Response Committee to reach out to
  for triaging and handling of incoming issues
- *MUST* accept the [Embargo Policy]

### Other Roles

This governance document outlines the required roles for SIGs: Chair and Tech
Lead; however, SIGs are allowed to operate how they see fit outside of minimum
governance requirements, including defining more roles to sustain the group. If
a SIG needs to change the Chair and Tech Lead position to include or remove
duties, this needs to be approved by the Steering Committee. Newly created roles
that don't assume any responsibility of Chair and/or Tech Lead should follow
the governing processes in the SIGs charter. 

Example of SIG roles created to help operations:

- [The Release Team: Bug Triage, CI Signal, and more]
- [API Reviewer and Moderator]
- [Production Readiness Reviewer]
- [Events Lead]
- [PR Wrangler]
- [Contributor Comms]

Other roles...
- *MUST* be tracked on the SIGs README with a link to the role definition.
- *MUST* have the Steering Committees approval to proceed with roles that
  assume duties from Chairs and/or Tech Leads on a non-temporary basis.
- *SHOULD* be documented in SIG charters if the role has delegation away from a
  sig-governance.md listed role.
- *SHOULD* be sent to dev@kubernetes.io for awareness as a notice with a lazy
  consensus period when they are newly created
- *MAY* Fill in for another named role on a temporary basis


## Subprojects

### Subproject Creation

Subprojects may be created with a simple majority vote of SIG Technical Leads.
- [sigs.yaml] *MUST* be updated to include subproject information and [OWNERS]
  files with subproject owners.
- Where subprojects processes differ from the SIG governance, they must
  document how. e.g. if subprojects release separately - they must document
  how release and planning is performed

### Subproject Requirements

Subprojects broadly fall into two categories, those that are directly part
of [Kubernetes] core and those that are tool, driver, or other component that
do not adhere to the Kubernetes release cycle.

**Kubernetes Core Subprojects**
- *MUST* use the [KEP] process for introducing new features and decision
  making.
- *MUST* Adhere to release test health requirements.

**Non Kubernetes Core Subprojects**
- *SHOULD* define how releases are performed.
- *SHOULD* setup and monitor test health.

Issues impacting multiple subprojects in the SIG should be resolved by the
SIG's Tech Leads or a federation of Subproject Owners.


## SIG Retirement

In the event that the SIG is unable to regularly establish consistent quorum or
otherwise fulfill its Organizational Management responsibilities
- after 3 or more months it *SHOULD* be retired
- after 6 or more months it *MUST* be retired
