# Centos ci-cd

## Introduction
In some of the KubeVirt repos the ci-cd automation is done through the CentOS ci-cd located in https://ci.centos.org

That site uses the authentication sidecar of the CentOS OpenShift system in https://console.apps.ci.centos.org:8443

You need to get an account in that system to be able to deploy new ci-cd flows or check details of the already existing implementation.

## How to get an account

- The oficial guide is written in: https://wiki.centos.org/SIGGuide#head-593a859807e26a8299efeebda9e0aaf0d0b3a821

1. Visit https://bugs.centos.org
		- Create your account in the signup page https://bugs.centos.org/signup_page.php
		- Confirm your account with the email you'll get
		- Login within your new credentials
