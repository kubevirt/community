# Title
Running VMs on Raspberry Pi using KubeVirt

# Summary
The mission of the KubeVirt project is to manage virtual machines using a cluster orchestration engine such as Kubernetes or OpenShift. Because KubeVirt itself runs in a series of containers, it is not limited to a single host architecture--making it an ideal management solution in a hybrid cluster. Using a unified management approach simplifies deployments, allows for better resource utilization, and different workloads can be supported in a more optimal way. The goal of this session is to show the audience how to accomplish that.

This session is designed to familiarize the audience with KubeVirt and arm users with the practical experience they'll need to deploy Virtual Machines using it. This session will feature a live demonstration using a k3s cluster consisting of both x86_64 and raspberry pi nodes. Tune in to find out what we will run!
