# Community Meetings

At KubeVirt's present scale the community opts to host a weekly meeting.  This
gives users another channel to discuss important topics.  There is also value
in adding a `Let's get to know each other` touch to project work.

## Meeting Content

First and foremost all meetings must adhere to the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)

#### Introductions
* Organizers should introduce themselves and the meeting
* Organizers should allow new attendees to introduce themselves

#### Agenda - typically planned discussions added throughout the week
* Introduce each topic and/or contributor
* Allow ample time to discuss the topic.  Some topics may need to be time boxed
or broken out into mailing list, slack and/or separate community meetings.  

#### Open Agenda - typically ad hoc discussions

#### Bug Scrub - typically engs will run this section and review unreviewed issues
Last 20 minutes of each community meeting are dedicated to scrubbing of
KubeVirt Issues. Precedence should be given to Issues raised by attendees. The
remaining of the time should be spent going over Issues one by one starting
from the most recent one. Each Issue we visit should be given one of the
following triage labels:

* triage/accepted: Indicates an issue or PR is ready to be actively worked on.
* triage/duplicate: Indicates an issue is a duplicate of other open issue.
* triage/needs-information: Indicates an issue needs more information in order
to work on it.
* triage/not-reproducible: Indicates an issue can not be reproduced as described.
* triage/unresolved: Indicates an issue that can not or will not be resolved.

Some topics may need to be time boxed or broken out into mailing list, slack
and/or separate community meetings

Repos that should be reviewed:
* [kubevirt/kubevirt](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues)
* [kubevirt/user-guide](https://github.com/kubevirt/user-guide/issues)
