# KubeVirt HyperConverged Cluster Operator: What is New, What to Expect

# Abstract
The [HyperConverged Cluster operator](https://github.com/kubevirt/hyperconverged-cluster-operator) (HCO) is a unified operator
deploying and controlling KubeVirt and several adjacent operators:
* Containerized Data Importer
* Scheduling, Scale and Performance
* Cluster Network Addons
* Node Maintenance

The purpose of HCO is to ease the deployment, upgrade, monitoring and configuration of an opinionated version of the he KubeVirt cluster.

In this session will cover the following topics:
1. Why we think that an opinionated deployment and a single source of truth for the whole product is really important
2. The APIs that we defined up to know and their design principles (OpenAPIv3 validation, clear explanation for oc explain 
   and for the UI, versioning, how to propose a new value, how retire an older value...)
