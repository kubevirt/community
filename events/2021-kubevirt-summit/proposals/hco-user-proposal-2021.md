# KubeVirt opinionated deployment via Hyperconverged Cluster Operator

# Abstract

How deploy KubeVirt and several adjacent operators with ease

The [HyperConverged Cluster operator](https://github.com/kubevirt/hyperconverged-cluster-operator) (HCO) is a unified operator
deploying and controlling KubeVirt and several adjacent operators:
* Containerized Data Importer
* Scheduling, Scale and Performance
* Cluster Network Addons
* Node Maintenance

The purpose of HCO is to ease the deployment, upgrade, monitoring and configuration of an opinionated version of the KubeVirt cluster.

The Hyperconverged Cluster Operator can be installed on bare metal server clusters in a matter of minutes, even from a GUI, without requiring a deep knowledge of Kubernetes internals. 

An attendee will learn:
* how to deploy and maintain a KubeVirt cluster with the Hyperconverged Cluster Operator
* demo
* ongoing development and how to contribute
