# Title

Automating KubeVirt with Tekton Pipelines

# Abstract

This talk will introduce a new effort to bring KubeVirt specific tasks to Tekton Pipelines (CI/CD-style pipelines on k8s).
The goal of this project is to have tasks for managing VMs and running virtualized workloads as part of the pipelines flow.

The speaker will showcase what pipelines you can build at the moment, and what are the plans for the future.
