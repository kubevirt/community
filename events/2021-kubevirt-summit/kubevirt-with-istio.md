# Title

Kubevirt with Istio service mesh

# Abstract

Kubevirt allows developers to gradually adopt Kubernetes by allowing to run legacy virtual machine-based services and applications
alongside modern containerized distributed services and applications.

Istio is a widely used implementation of a service mesh. Service mesh provides additional capabilities like observability, traffic management, load balancing, resilience, and so on. As a result of using Istio, these capabilities can be offloaded from the application itself, which allows it to focus on the business logic instead.

In this session, I will demonstrate deployment of Istio and running virtual machines in a service mesh.
