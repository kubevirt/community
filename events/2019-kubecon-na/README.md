## Meetup

There is some initial work to evaluate if we have space to do a KubeVirt
gathering on site during the conference.

Have a room at KubeCon to allow people interested in KubeVirt to sit together.

And a few sessions to have a little guidance/structure.

### Summary

This gathering shall be used to discuss and brainstorm what topics are of
interest to the current users and developers of KubeVirt, and how they and
others can be solved - also in the Kubernetes context.

### Tasks

- [ ] Find a room
